RISK CALCULATION GUIDE,,,,,,,,,,
Likelihood Scale,Likelihood Description,,,Impact Scale,Impact Description,,,Risk Rating Matrix,,
1,Very Unlikely,Very rare occurrence (less than 5% probability),,,1,Negligible,Minimal or no impact,,,Likelihood × Impact = Risk Rating,
2,Unlikely,Uncommon but possible (5-25% probability),,,2,Minor,Limited impact to operations,,,1-4 = Low Risk,
3,Possible,Might occur at some point (25-50% probability),,,3,Moderate,Significant impact but containable,,,5-9 = Medium Risk,
4,Likely,Will probably occur (50-75% probability),,,4,Major,Major impact on operations or objectives,,,10-16 = High Risk,
5,Almost Certain,Expected to occur (>75% probability),,,5,Severe,Critical impact threatening mission success,,,17-25 = Critical Risk,
